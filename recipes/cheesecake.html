        <ol>
            <li>4 8-ounce packages of cream cheese</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cup finely crushed graham crackers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2/3 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>2 8-ounce cartons sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
        <p>Allow cream chese and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, for crust, in a large bowl crushed graham crackers, the 1 tablespoon sugar, and, if desired, the cinnamon. Stir in melted butter. Press the crumb mixture onto the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan; set aside.</p>
        <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
        <P>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a large mixing bowl beat cream cheese and the 1-1/4 cups sugar with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until fluffy. Beat in flour on low speed until smooth. Using a fork, lightly beat the eggs. Add the eggs and 3 teaspoons of the vanilla all at once, beating on low speed just until combined. Stir in 1/2 cup of the sour cream. Pour batter into the crust-lined pan. Place in a shallow baking pan in oven.</P>
        <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
        <p>Bake for 40 minutes or until a 2 1/2-inch area around the outside edge appears set when gently shaken. Remove from oven. In a medium bowl stir together the remaining sour cream, the 1/4 cup sugar, and the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla. Using a spoon, spread mixture evenly over top of baked cheesecake. Return to oven and bake for 15 minutes more.</p>
        <P><h4>Step 4</h4></P>
        <p>Cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Using a small sharp knife, loosen crust from sides of pan. Cool for 30 minutes more. Remove sides of pan; cool completely on rack. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>
        <P><h4>Enjoy!</h4></P>
